The given code is an implementation of Dijkstra's algorithm to find the shortest distance from a source vertex to all other vertices in a weighted graph. Here's the algorithm:

1. Create a priority queue to store nodes with their corresponding distances. Initialize a vector `dist` to store the shortest distances from the source vertex to all other vertices.
2. Initialize all distances in `dist` as infinity (or a large value), except for the source vertex which is set to 0.
3. Push the source vertex and its distance (0) into the priority queue.
4. While the priority queue is not empty, do the following:
   a. Extract the node with the minimum distance from the priority queue.
   b. Iterate through all the adjacent nodes of the extracted node.
   c. For each adjacent node, calculate the new distance as the sum of the current distance and the weight of the edge connecting the current node to the adjacent node.
   d. If the new distance is smaller than the current distance stored in `dist`, update `dist` with the new distance and push the adjacent node and its new distance into the priority queue.
5. After the algorithm finishes, the `dist` vector will contain the shortest distances from the source vertex to all other vertices.
6. Return the `dist` vector.

The algorithm uses a priority queue to select the node with the smallest distance in each iteration, ensuring that the node with the minimum distance is processed first.

Please note that the given code assumes 0-based indexing for the vertices. If your graph uses 1-based indexing, you may need to adjust the indices accordingly.
