Here is the algorithm for the given code:

1. Define the `Job` structure with `id`, `dead`, and `profit` as members.
2. Define the `Solution` class.
3. Implement the static comparison function `comparison` to sort the jobs based on profit in descending order.
4. Implement the `JobScheduling` function that takes an array of `Job` objects and the number of jobs as input.
5. Sort the array of jobs in descending order of profit using the `comparison` function.
6. Find the maximum deadline (`maxi`) among all jobs in the sorted array.
7. Create an array `slot` of size `maxi + 1` and initialize all elements to -1.
8. Initialize variables `countJobs` and `jobProfit` to 0.
9. Iterate over each job in the sorted array.
10. For each job, starting from its deadline, iterate downwards.
11. If the current slot is available (i.e., `slot[j] == -1`), assign the job to that slot.
12. Increment `countJobs` and accumulate the profit by adding the job's profit to `jobProfit`.
13. Break the loop after assigning the job.
14. Return a pair containing `countJobs` and `jobProfit`.
15. In the `main` function, create an array of jobs and initialize them with their respective values.
16. Create an object of the `Solution` class.
17. Call the `JobScheduling` function on the object, passing the array of jobs and the number of jobs as arguments.
18. Print the number of jobs done and the maximum profit obtained.

The provided code already implements this algorithm correctly.
